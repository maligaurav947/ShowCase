          <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
            1) While there had been tensions between Russia and Ukraine, a
            former Soviet republic, for a long time, the situation began getting
            out of control in early 2021. In January last year, Ukrainian
            President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged US President Joe Biden to let
            Ukraine join NATO.
            <br /><br />
            2) This angered Russia, which started sending troops near its
            Ukraine border for "training exercises" in spring last year and
            increased it during autumn. By December, the US began hyping up the
            deployment of the Russian troops and President Biden warned of
            severe sanctions if Russia invaded Ukraine.
            <br /><br />
            3) Russia has demanded that the West gives a legally binding
            guarantee that NATO will not hold any military activity in eastern
            Europe and Ukraine. Vladimir Putin claims Ukraine is a puppet of the
            West and was never a proper state anyway.
            <br /><br />
            4) This is not the first time tensions between Russia and Ukraine
            has reached a boiling point. Russia had invaded Ukraine in 2014 when
            rebels backed by President Putin had seized large swathes of
            easterrn Ukraine and have fought Ukraine's army since then. At that
            time, Russia had annexed Crimea.
            <br /><br />
            5) As a former Soviet republic Ukraine has deep social and cultural
            ties with Russia, and Russian is widely spoken there, but ever since
            Russia invaded in 2014 those relations have frayed.
            <br /><br />
            6) Russia attacked Ukraine when its pro-Russian president was
            deposed in early 2014. The war in the east has since claimed more
            than 14,000 lives.
            <br /><br />
            7) Russia and Ukraine had signed the Minsk peace accord to halt the
            armed conflict in east Ukraine, including the Donbas region. But as
            the conflict has continued, Russia says it is sending "peacekeepers"
            to the region where the conflict is brewing. The West calls it a
            smokescreen by Moscow to occupy sovereign territory.
            <br /><br />
            8) The new tension between Russia and Ukraine, which also borders
            the European Union, has repurcussions for the EU. And that's why the
            EU, most of who are NATO signatories have joined the US in
            announcing sanctions, against Russian entities.
            <br /><br />
            9) Just weeks ago, French President Emmanuel Macron flew to Moscow
            to talk to President Putin to reduce tensions.
            <br /><br />
            10) India has called for a diplomatic way out of the current crisis
            between Russia and Ukraine. <br />
